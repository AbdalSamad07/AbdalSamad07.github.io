      <h3>Abd-Al-Samad-Syed </h3>
      <p>Ever since i was in High School, I've always been intruiged by how coding and computer interaction works. 
       I used to code with Python back then and now throughout my years of being a student studying the industry of Computer Science, ive learnt other programming languages such as Greenfoot, Visual Basic, Java etc. 
       </p>I intend to have a successful career within the Cyber Security field. Therefore, it is vital for me to understand the depth of the
       programming language. The image shown on the right, is one of the projects that I carried out during my time at College. This was the
       main game for the year that I had to create.

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Retro 2 Player Game</h3>
    <p>
	This is my first project carried out to conclude the 2 weeks of Bootcamp that took place at City. 
        This processing project demonstrates various uses of technique such as classes and objects.
        Also, shows many use of condition statements to carry out certain actions within the game.
        I created and developed a Retro Ball Game that allows 2 player functionality. To layout the structure
        of the coding, I used classes such as Ball and Player to distinguish the main functions of the game. 
	Each player is controlled using either "w" and "s" or "UP and "DOWN". The main aimof this game is to
	guide the players position to score in the opposing goal. However, players can only move vertically
	across the game's setting. After every goal scored, the ball will reposition itself in the centre and
	will shoot out to the opposing player. Once one of the player reaches 10 points, the game is finished.

    <h3>Greenfoot Project: 2D Game, Spaceship Game</h3>
    <p>
	My Greenfoot project involved spaceships, asteroids, and different levels. This was a 
 	great opportunity for me to develop my skills with Object oriented programming by utilising
	many different classes to run the game. I also learnt more about how GUI works within games 
	and how they can programmed can carry out different functions.
