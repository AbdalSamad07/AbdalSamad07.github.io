      <h3>Abd-Al-Samad-Syed </h3>
      <p>Ever since i was in High School, I've always been intruiged by how coding and computer interaction works. 
       I used to code with Python back then and now throughout my years of being a student studying the industry of Computer Science, ive learnt other programming languages such as Greenfoot, Visual Basic, Java etc. 
       </p>I intend to have a successful career within the Cyber Security field. Therefore, it is vital for me to understand the depth of the
       programming language. The image shown on the right, is one of the projects that I carried out during my time at College. This was the
       main game for the year that I had to create.

    <h3>Programming in Java - Spaceship Game</h3>
    <p>
	This game is the final project that I have completed within the first year of studying at  
        City University. This project demonstrates all types of functions that I have learnt throughout
        my year.The Spaceship consists of 5 levels with the rocket being the controllable character. Each level
        contains different rockets that get updates upon completeing the level.
	The player is controller through "w" and "s" to move and they can use the "spacebar" to shoot lasers. 
	I have implemented multiple collision methods such as Enemy Ships and Asteroids. This will be the enemies
	within the game. The player has 5 lives that get reset upon reaching other levels. I have also added a save
	and load state method that allows players to come back to their current level and progress throughout the game.

    <h3>Greenfoot Project: 2D Game, Spaceship Game</h3>
    <p>
	My Greenfoot project involved spaceships, asteroids, and different levels. This was a 
 	great opportunity for me to develop my skills with Object oriented programming by utilising
	many different classes to run the game. I also learnt more about how GUI works within games 
	and how they can programmed can carry out different functions.
